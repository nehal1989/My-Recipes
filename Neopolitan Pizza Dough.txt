Neopolitan Pizza Dough Recipe
You also need yeast. I use compressed fresh yeast that you can also find in supermarkets especially if they have a bakery. Morrisons sells it or you can ask some at the bakery counter, Tesco has it too. I have never used active dry yeast but I know you could.

Ratios for 1Kg of flour (makes 6 pizza):
1Kg Flour 00
600 ml water (not warm)
30 g fine sea salt
A pea-sized piece of compressed fresh yeast (~1 g) – if using active dry yeast use ~0.5 g

Procedure:
    • Dissolve the salt in the water
    • Add 10% of the total amount of flour and use your fingers to break the clumps of flour. Do this before putting in yeast!!
    • Add yeast and use fingers to dissolve it in the water
    • Add 50% of the total amount of flour and work with your hands to mix it well with the water. At the end it will look a bit clumpy
    • Add the rest of the flour in small amounts and work it with your hands to incorporate it before adding more
    • Once it looks homogeneous transfer the dough on the table and knead it for 5-10 minutes
    • Cover the dough (with a bowl or a wet cloth) and let it rest for 10 minutes. Once rested it should look smoother and softer
    • Knead it for 5 more minutes on the table
    • Place the dough in a air-tight container and leave it to prove for 15-20 hours at room temperature (use a large enough container as it will double or triple in size)
    • Divide the dough in balls. I do 250g balls for each pizza. Leave them to prove and relax for 3-4 hours at room temperature in a air-tight container
    • Baking is best using a pizza stone. With a standard home oven I suggest to place the stone in the oven on the top shelf, switch on the oven and the grill too at the top temperature. Once it has reached the temperature wait at least 30 minutes before baking so that the stone is well hot and saturated
    • Stretch the pizza, add the toppings and place the pizza on the stone. Baking time varies with the oven and the temperature reached but should be ~5-6 minutes per pizza.
    • Enjoy!
