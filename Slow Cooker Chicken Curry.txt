Ingredients:
1 tbsp vegetable oil
1 onion chopped
3 garlic cloves crushed
1 tsp ground cumin
1 tsp ground coriander
1.5 tbsp garam masala (I used 1.5 tsps and it worked well as I misread)
1 tsp paprika (I think this is for some spice, probably can use something else too)
2 tbsp tomato puree
2.5 cm fresh ginger 
400g tinned tomatoes
200mL coconut milk
1 tsp caster sugar
650 g chicken thighs (I used 500g and though it was fine actually). Cut in 6 cm chunks.
1 tsp salt
Fresh coriander to garnish

Method:

1) Heat the oil in a medium pan over medium heat and fry onions until soft, about 8-10min.

2) Stir in the garlic, cumin, coriander, garam masala and 1tsp paprika and fry for 1min until aromatic. Add the tomato pur√©e and cook for a further min.  Stir in the ginger, tomatoes, coconut milk and sugar.

3) Transfer onion mixture to the slow cooker and stir in the chicken and some seasoning (salt). Cover with the lid and cook on Medium for 6-8hr. (Original recipe calls for cooking on low but medium worked fine)

4) When the chicken is cooked and you're ready to serve, check seasoning and add more paprika to taste, if it needs a touch more spice. Stir in half the coriander, divide between four bowls and sprinkle with remaining coriander. Serve with rice, naan breads and mango chutney, if you like.
